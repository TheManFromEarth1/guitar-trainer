**Dear guitar player,**

If you have problems with learning notes on the fretboard, you are not alone. I riveted a thing for you and me, expanding, in fact, the tunerâ€™s functionality - interactive display of the played note on a virtual brown neck, as well as duplication of the note on the keys.
Well, + scales / frets / basic tuner (I will supplement)

It seems to work, but it only determines 1 playable sound at a time.

Perhaps it will be easier for you.

**You can try it here:**
